In this audio file is being processed.
The following process is done throughout the project
1. Reading an Audio File:
The audio file is read using the "audioread" function.
The signal is plotted with the x-axis representing the sample number 
and the y-axis representing the amplitude of the signal, which is a typical step in signal analysis to observe how the signal behaves over time.


2. Fourier Transform:
The signal undergoes a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which converts the time-domain signal into the frequency domain.
The magnitude squared (abs(y.^2)) of the FFT is taken, which helps analyze the power spectrum of the signal. 
This step gives insight into the frequency components of the signal.


3. Frequency Domain Analysis:
Only the first half of the frequency spectrum is used (y = y(1:n/2)), as the FFT result is symmetric for real-valued signals.
The code computes a frequency scale (f_scale) based on the sampling rate fs and the number of samples n.
A graph of the dominant frequency components is plotted.


4. Estimating Dominant Frequency:
The code identifies the peak frequency component, which represents the dominant frequency in the signal.
The dominant frequency is printed along with the frequency step (resolution), which shows how accurately the frequencies are being resolved.


Overall, this assignment focuses on processing and analyzing an audio signal, specifically looking at its frequency content using Fourier analysis. 
The project involves calculating the dominant frequency and analyzing the spectral properties of the audio signal.
